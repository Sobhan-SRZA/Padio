# Padio Setup and Command Guide

Welcome to the Padio guide! This page will walk you through how to set up Padio on your Discord server and explain how to use its various commands to get the most out of your radio experience.

## Getting Started

Before you begin using Padio, make sure you have invited the bot to your server. Once Padio is on your server, follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Invite Padio:**  
   Use the invite link provided on our homepage to add Padio to your server.

2. **Run Setup Commands:**  
   Padio requires a few initial setup commands to configure its behavior on your server. The key setup commands are:
   - **Panel Setup:**  
     Use `/setup panel` (or `p!setup panel` if you’re using a message-based command) to create a control panel.  
     This command will:
     - Request permission to access a specific text channel.
     - Send a control message in that channel.
     - Save the channel ID and message ID in the database for future control and management.
     
   - **Prefix Setup:**  
     Use `/setup prefix` (or `p!setup prefix`) to set a custom command prefix for Padio.  
     This allows administrators to define a unique prefix for invoking bot commands. The chosen prefix, along with your server ID, is saved in our database.
     
   - **Language Setup:**  
     Use `/setup language` (or `p!setup language`) to select the bot’s language.  
     Available languages include English, فارسی, Türkçe, 中文, and 日本語. Your choice, along with the language code and server ID, is stored to personalize the bot’s responses.

3. **AFK Mode Activation:**  
   Use the `/afk` command (or `p!afk [channel | id]`) to enable the 24/7 mode for Padio.  
   - When enabled, Padio will continuously remain in the designated voice channel.
   - The bot saves the voice channel ID and server ID in the database, ensuring that it stays active even if the server is idle.

4. **Radio Station Selection:**  
   The last selected radio station (e.g., “Bass Radio” or “Radio Javan”) is automatically saved in the database alongside your server ID.  
   This ensures that Padio can resume playing your preferred station when needed.

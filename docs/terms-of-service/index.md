# Padio Terms of Service

## Introduction
By using Padio, you agree to the following Terms of Service. These conditions are designed to ensure a safe, secure, and efficient environment for all users.

## General Rules
- **Administrative Access**: Only authorized server administrators may use setup commands (e.g., `/setup panel`, `/setup prefix`, `/setup language`) to configure Padio. All settings changes are stored with your server’s unique ID.
- **AFK Mode and Radio Playback**: When the `/afk` command is used, Padio remains active in the designated voice channel 24/7. Additionally, the last selected radio station is stored as the default station.
- **Command Usage**: Commands such as `/play`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/stop`, and `/volume` should be used according to Discord’s guidelines and in a manner that respects other users. Any misuse or disruptive behavior may result in restricted access or removal of the bot from your server.

## User Responsibilities
- **Accuracy of Information**: Users are responsible for providing accurate and up-to-date information when configuring Padio. Any misuse of the bot resulting from incorrect information is the user’s responsibility.
- **No Abuse**: The use of Padio for illegal activities, spamming, harassment, or any malicious behavior is strictly prohibited. Violations may lead to appropriate administrative or legal actions.

## Limitation of Liability
- Padio is provided on an "as-is" basis without any warranties regarding uninterrupted or error-free performance.
- We are not liable for any direct or indirect damages resulting from the use or inability to use Padio, including but not limited to service interruptions or technical issues.

## Modifications to the Terms of Service
We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Any changes will be announced via our website or direct notifications to server administrators. Continued use of Padio after such modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

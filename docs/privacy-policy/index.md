# Padio Privacy Policy

## Introduction
Padio is an advanced radio bot for Discord voice channels that allows users to enjoy a wide variety of trending online radio streams with high-quality, seamless performance. Our goal is to provide a transparent and secure experience for both server administrators and users. This policy explains how we collect, store, and use settings and configuration data for Padio.

## Data Collection
Padio collects the following information through administrative setup commands and user interactions, which is stored in our database:

- **Radio Control Panel Setup**: When an admin uses the `/setup panel` command, Padio requests permission to access a designated text channel and send a control message. The channel ID and the control message ID are stored.
- **Custom Prefix Setup**: Using the `/setup prefix` command, administrators can set a custom prefix for bot commands. The chosen prefix is saved along with the server ID.
- **Language Setup**: Through the `/setup language` command, an admin selects the desired language (available languages include English, فارسی, Türkçe, 中文, and 日本語). The selected language code and server ID are stored.
- **AFK Mode (24/7 Feature)**: When admins enable the `/afk` command, Padio saves the voice channel ID and the server ID to remain active in that voice channel continuously.
- **Last Selected Radio Station**: The name of the most recently chosen radio station is stored in the database along with the server ID.
- **Usage Statistics**: General command usage data (e.g., the total number of commands used) is also recorded for analysis and service improvement.

## How We Use Your Data
The collected data is used solely to enhance your experience with Padio, manage server-specific settings, and ensure proper bot functionality. Specifically, we use your data for:
- **Configuration Management**: Saving your server’s panel settings, custom prefix, and language choice to personalize your bot experience.
- **AFK Mode Management**: Maintaining the bot’s continuous presence in designated voice channels based on saved AFK settings.
- **Performance Analytics**: Analyzing overall usage to improve service performance and update features accordingly.

## Data Security
We employ industry-standard security measures to protect the data collected by Padio. All information is stored in a secure database and is only accessible for technical and administrative purposes. We do not collect any sensitive personal data beyond the necessary server configuration details.

## Data Sharing
Your data is used exclusively for the purpose of operating and improving Padio. We will not share your data with third parties, except when:
- It is necessary to provide technical support or processing (for example, handling payment information during donations, if applicable).
- Required by law or to protect the security of our systems.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this document periodically. Continued use of Padio implies acceptance of any changes made.
